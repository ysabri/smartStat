# SmartStat

Smart home automation thermostat project that runs on a Raspberry Pi. It uses two servo motors along with a temprature sensor
to flip a switch. It also integrates with Google Home.

* Here is an album showing how it looks like: https://imgur.com/a/Tp7i25f and a video showing how it works with Google Home: https://youtu.be/3-etgQS_Go0
* This is a Spring Boot Gradle project that will only start successfully on a Linux system with python. It also assumes specific connection configurations to the Raspberry Pi board for the SG90 servos and DS18B20 temperature sensor, check the scripts in the pyScripts for the configs
* The oauth code is not intended for any serious use, meaning it is not secure by any means, it doesnâ€™t persist any refresh tokens, and very possibly has other issues. The config properties for it are left out of the project for obvious reasons
* The REST endpoints Google Home talks to are exposed using ngrok in my setup of the project
* The thermostat is setup to use Fahrenheit exact values, it probes the temperature every 20 minutes. This behavior can be overridden by explicitly calling the on and off endpoints. Calling the setTemp endpoint will turn off the override and trigger a check for every call regardless of the 20 minutes timer checks
